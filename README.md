More Full Clear abbreviations such as PFC+ and GFC.  
  
It only works if you have PFC/FC abbreviations on alongside the colored star. Switching between these (abbreviations vs. no abbreviations) in the middle of playing a chart bugs out the mod - if this happens, replay the chart.  
  
Unfortunately, the new abbreviations (anything that isn't PFC or FC) aren't integrated with the localization and will only show up as what they stand for in English. Sorry.  
  
 
Full list, ordered by lowest judgment achieved:  
* Perfect Plus - PFC+  
* Perfect - PFC  
* Great - GFC  
* Good - FC  
* Okay (Early or Late) - FC  
* Miss - none, obviously  

If you want Great to be GFC+ and Good to be GFC (leaving the only "FC" ranking to be Okay) download v0.3.0 instead of the latest v0.4.0.
